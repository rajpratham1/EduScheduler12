EduScheduler - Modified bundle
------------------------------

What I changed (starter changes):
- Unzipped your original project.
- Added a `backend/` folder with a simple Express server (server.js) that:
  - Serves two endpoints: GET /api/schedules and POST /api/schedules
  - Uses Firebase Admin SDK if you supply backend/serviceAccountKey.json
  - Falls back to an in-memory store if Firebase is not configured

- Added a frontend firebase.js placeholder (if index.html found) to help integrate Firebase client SDK.
- Added small CSS/UI effects helpers (fade-in, button-glow) and injected into index.html if present.
- Included instructions to set up Firebase and how to deploy to Render.

Next steps you should do:
1. Replace Firebase config placeholders in frontend/firebase.js and backend/server.js with real project values.
2. Place your Firebase service account JSON at backend/serviceAccountKey.json.
3. Run `npm install` inside backend and then `npm start` to run the API locally.
4. Update frontend API base URLs if you'll host backend separately (e.g., https://your-render-app.onrender.com/api)

I did NOT modify application-specific logic because I inspected files but did not change project-specific code. If you'd like, I can:
- Attempt automated fixes (lint + common bugs) across frontend code.
- Wire Firestore reads/writes directly into your existing frontend components.
- Make panels fully functional by editing the exact files (I will need to modify project-specific files).

Since this is a best-effort quick integration, please tell me if you'd like me to:
- Proceed to wire Firebase into specific frontend files (I will modify them).
- Create scripts for build and deployment to Render.

---- Additional Integrations Applied ----
- Frontend Firebase client helpers (services/firebase.ts) now include phone OTP helpers, unique ID generator, avatar list and profile upsert helper.
- Admin schedule configuration endpoints added at backend (`POST /api/settings/schedule_config`) and frontend helper functions added in `services/api.ts` (setScheduleConfig/getScheduleConfig).
- Review workflow: `services/api.ts` contains `submitReview` & `setReviewStatus`. Backend endpoint `POST /api/review` forwards review to Formspree (token from env FORMSPREE_TOKEN or default 'xvgrnpyb') and stores review in Firestore.
- Avatars added under `public/avatars/*.svg` for quick profile image choices.

IMPORTANT: After deployment, set environment vars (for Render or local .env):
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY, VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN, VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID, VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET, VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID, VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
Also set backend FORMSPREE_TOKEN to your formspree token (or keep default), and place Firebase service account at backend/serviceAccountKey.json
